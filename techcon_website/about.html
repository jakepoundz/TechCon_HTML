             <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
             <p>TechCon is an annual conference that brings together the brightest minds in the tech industry 
                to share ideas, learn from each other, and shape the future of technology. The first Tech
                Con was held in 2010 and has since grown to become one of the most anticipated events
                in the tech calendar. Over the years, TechCon has featured keynote speakers from top tech
                companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, as well as innovative startups and
                industry thought leaders. The conference has also expanded to include workshops, panel
                discussions, and networking opportunities, making it a must-attend event for anyone 
                interested in technology and innovation.</p>
